# 📊 Trading Indicators – Overview & Usage

## 1. Momentum Indicators
Momentum indicators measure the **strength and speed** of price movements.  
They help identify **overbought** or **oversold** conditions.

### 🔹 Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- **Range:** 0 – 100  
- **RSI > 70:** Market is **overbought** → possible reversal down (sell signal).  
- **RSI < 30:** Market is **oversold** → possible reversal up (buy signal).  
- ⚠️ **Caution:** In a strong uptrend, RSI can stay above 70 for a long time (don’t sell too early).  
- ✅ **Best use:** Combine RSI with **trend indicators** to confirm whether to trust the signal.

## 2. Trend Indicators
Trend indicators identify the **overall direction** of the market: bullish, bearish, or sideways.  
They are best for confirming if you should **follow** or **avoid** a trade.

### 🔹 Moving Averages
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Smooths price by averaging over N periods (e.g., SMA20).  
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** Gives more weight to recent prices → reacts faster.  
- **How to use:**  
  - Price **above SMA20/EMA20** → Uptrend.  
  - Price **below SMA20/EMA20** → Downtrend.  
- ✅ Works well to filter RSI signals.  
  - Example: If RSI < 30 **and** price is above SMA20 → good **buy opportunity** (oversold but in uptrend).  

### 🔹 MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Uses fast & slow EMAs to show momentum + trend direction.  
- **Signal:** When MACD line crosses the signal line → potential entry/exit.  
- ✅ Strong when confirming RSI or SMA signals.

## 3. Volatility Indicators
Volatility indicators measure **how wild the price moves** (risk and breakout potential).

### 🔹 Bollinger Bands
- Bands built around a moving average using **standard deviation**.  
- **Price touches upper band:** Market may be overbought (similar to RSI high).  
- **Price touches lower band:** Market may be oversold.  
- **Band squeeze (narrow bands):** Low volatility → breakout likely soon.  

### 🔹 Average True Range (ATR)
- Measures the **average daily range** of price moves.  
- High ATR = high volatility (more risk & opportunity).  
- Low ATR = calmer market.  
- ✅ Often used to set stop-loss levels.

## 📌 How to Combine Indicators (Best Practice)

- **Never rely on just one indicator** → each type has strengths & weaknesses.  
- A common approach is:  
  1. **Trend Indicator** (SMA/EMA/MACD) → Confirm direction.  
  2. **Momentum Indicator** (RSI) → Identify entry/exit timing.  
  3. **Volatility Indicator** (Bollinger/ATR) → Manage risk & anticipate breakouts.  

### Example Strategy (RSI + SMA20 + Bollinger)
- ✅ **Buy Setup:**  
  - RSI < 30 (oversold)  
  - Price above SMA20 (still in uptrend)  
  - Bollinger Bands show squeeze (possible breakout up)  

- ❌ **Sell Setup:**  
  - RSI > 70 (overbought)  
  - Price below SMA20 (trend weakening)  
  - ATR rising (volatility increasing → possible big drop)

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
- **Momentum = strength of move (RSI, MACD)**  
- **Trend = direction of move (SMA, EMA, MACD)**  
- **Volatility = size of move (Bollinger, ATR)**  
- Combine at least one of each type for better accuracy.  
- Always consider **market context** (trending vs. ranging).
